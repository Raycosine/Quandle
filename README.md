# Quandle
A quantum variant of wordle.

This is the project submitted to Quantum Game Jam 2022. During Quantum Games Hackathon, a few more features were added.

# How to play

You'll immediately know how to play quandle if you already know some basic quantum knowledge and wordle! Watch the [Game trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_zJioewPww) on YouTube.

## Daily & Practice
Consider |a>, ..., |z> as the basis "single-character" states. An n-letter "word state" looks like |qubit>, and any state on superposition can be written in the same way as quantum states: |qubit>+|qudit>, |qu>(|b>+|d>)|it>, ...For simplicity, the coefficients are not considered in this game.

The goal is to find the classical description of an n-letter word state on the superposition of k unknown words. For the example above, we need to find out the two words 'qubit' and 'qudit'.

If you choose 'Daily', the word state for each day is fixed.

## Anagram
You are now given all the superpositions that are anagrams: For example, 'propitiousness' and 'superpositions'. But the amplitudes are unknown. No worries, they'll be unnormalized, bounded integers. You can now modify the amplitudes to find a state close enough!
